### Factorial calculator written in C

Really basic project made for college as exploration of building simple TUI interfaces drawn by C
in a terminal window.

This was motivated by my deep fascination with UI related to webdev. I wanted to see how much more can be done with a simple

task like "write a factorial calculator in C".

Included:

- Full TUI with colours and boxes drawn.
- Use of ascii artwork to enhance the presentation of the welcome “splash screen” of the application as well as the “exit screen”.
- Extensive use of ascii escape sequences to colour the output, redraw the screen, manipulate the position of the terminal cursor etc.
- Quasi-animation used to present the calculation process with updated output and calculated paddings that convincingly simulate 
  
  dynamic output.
- Basic menu (even if only one functional option and an exit option are needed and offered to the user).
- Full input validation only allowing valid numbers as menu options, and only allowing integers from the range of 1-20 as calculator input. 
  
  Erroneous input outputs a user-facing prompt.
